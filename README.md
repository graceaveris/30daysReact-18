**Day Eighteen - 30 days of React challenge - Background Colour Changerr**

An app which allows the user to change the background colour of the interfact using a form.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Passing data from the child to the parent
- Callbacks to update the parent component

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
